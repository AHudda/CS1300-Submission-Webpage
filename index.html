        <h3 class="headerText">I. Introduction</h3>
        <p class="bodyText">My objective for this project was to redesign a web interface effectively. After selecting a website to redesign, I completed one cycle of the design process: quick sketching, a final sketch, low-fidelity wireframes, and high-fidelity mockups for three different screen sizes (phone, tablet, computer). Then, I created my redesigned, responsive website using HTML and CSS and reflected on the process. I really enjoyed this learning experience. This project helped me develop my understanding of what constitutes an effective versus an ineffective interface design, improve my coding skills, and think critically about my own work.</p>

        <h3 class="headerText">II. Identifying Usability Problems</h3>
        <h4 class="bodyText">Picking A Webpage</h4>
        <p class="bodyText">This is the website for my neighborhood’s community association in Washington D.C. A little while ago I was trying to help my mom donate to the association and we found that the website was very difficult to navigate, which is why I chose it for this project. I hope to present them with this redesign proposal! The original webpage can be found <a href="https://foxhall.org/">here</a>.</p>

        <h4 class="bodyText">Usability of Webpage</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Font size: font size was small and difficult to read & random bolded phrases?</li>
          <li>Color contrast: some of the color choices (the light green on white, maroon red versus black) decreased readability</li>
          <li>Unclear visual hierarchy: no visually distinct headers & difficult to see links versus subheaders versus body text</li>
          <li>Unclear information hierarchy: the information isn't ordered in a memorable, easily understandable way</li>
          <li>No good visual entry point to the page: picture takes up most of the space but isn't the most important element</li>
          <li>Confusing navigation bar: categories aren't well defined, the most important category (Contacts) isn't even there</li>
          <li>Overwhelming drop-down menu options: each category in the navigation bar has a long, confusing list of drop down items</li>
          <li>Numerous links (all in red) on the main page: overwhelming number of choices</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="bodyText">Accessibility of Webpage</h4>
        <p class="bodyText">I agree with the problems detected by WebAIM WAVE. Some of the images have empty alternative text boxes or are missing alternative text. Additionally, the text size is too small to read easily. One issue that WebAIM didn’t catch was the low color contrast in the header (white and light green), since the header is just an image. Another related problem is that there’s low color contrast between the maroon red (used to identify links) versus black (regular body text). Lastly, WebAIM didn't identify the general lack of headers (structural hierarchy) which surprised me.</p>

        <h4 class="bodyText">Speed Sketching</h4>
        <p class="bodyText">To begin my redesigning process, I started by quickly sketching 9 different designs that came to mind.</p>

        <h4 class="bodyText">Final Sketch</h4>
        <p class="bodyText">Combining my favorite elements from these 9 designs, I drafted a final sketch.</p>
        <img id="imageSpecifications" alt="final sketch" src="./assets/responsive_redesign/finalSketch.png"/>
        <h4 class="bodyText">Low Fidelity Wireframe</h4>
        <p class="bodyText">Using my final sketch for inspiration, I created a low fidelity wireframe in grayscale to more formally draft my design ideas.</p>

        <h4 class="bodyText">Visual Design Style Guide</h4>
        <p class="bodyText">Next, I formalized some design ideas in a visual style guide to ensure consistency between different elements on my webpage.</p>

        <h4 class="bodyText">High Fidelity Mockup</h4>
        <p class="bodyText">Combining my low fidelity wireframes with my visual design style guide, I created high fidelity mockups of my redesigned webpage.</p>
